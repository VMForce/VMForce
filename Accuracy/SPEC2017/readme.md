Here is accuracy results on SPEC2017.
We use serial numbers to uniquely identify the conditional transfers in the program to facilitate the statistical results of the experiments.
1.The folder "sample details" contains the details of the 7 samples.Each sample's folder has following files:
```
ct.txt - the conditional transfers in the program
rct.txt - the conditional transfers can be reached when running the program
```
For the samples larger than 1MB,their folders contain the ORCT which are obfuscated by different obfuscators.

2.The folder "results" contains the results of the samples obfuscated by different obfuscators.
